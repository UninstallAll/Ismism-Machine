HOW  Art  Museum  is  pleased  to  announce  that  the  exhibition  Eye  Height:  Jin  Yangping&  Kai Schiemenz will be on view at 2F Gallery at HOW Art Museum. The exhibition will present 85 sets of recent works by Chinese artist Jin Yangping and German artist Kai Schiemenz.

This  exhibition  is  another  collaboration  between  the  two  artists  after  2019.  Their  works  use different media and formal languages to discuss topics such as time, body, and environment in a cross-cultural context. The title of the exhibition "Eye Height" is a metaphor for the height and direction in which the eyes look, implying the direction of knowledge people read and seen.

Artist Jin Yangping  (*1971)  divided  his  works  in  the  exhibition  "Eye  Height"  into  five  distinct groups, imbuing each exhibit with its own unique narrative thread. First comes the chapter titled "Internal  Models",  where we confront various forms  and  models,  encompassing  both  painted and  sculpted  techniques.  The  most  representative  is  a  series  named  "Circular",  an  unusually shaped eyeball, appearing  less circular due to the absence of eyelids; and finally, a  hole in an unpainted  section  of  the  curtain.  When  we  view  this  series  as  a  whole  and  in  its  individual components, what do we see? What do these curtains unveil, and what remains hidden behind them?

What constitutes a sculpture?  Is it the three-dimensional spatial feature?  Is it the condition of observe  from  multiple  perspectives  by  walking?  Or  Is  it  the  construction  material,  extraction material, model or casting material of the artwork? In the sculptures of Kai Schiemenz (b. 1966 in Erfurt, Germany) there are two core concepts: surface and process. Each piece was once another object: types of rock/stone or polystyrene blocks were made into stained glass through silicone molds; computer graffiti was eventually transformed into ceramic tiles; or perhaps the concrete base has become an independent sculpture in the new environment. In addition to those two core concepts, they also include the concepts of architecture and urban space, from which these abstract objects are derived.

Returning to the term "Eye Height" itself, it not only links bodily dimensions with visual scope in technical terminology, defining what a person can purely see with their body; rather, here "Eye Height" implies mutual perception,  mutual recording, and  mutual respect. These two layers of meaning  seem fundamentally  opposite.  Due  to  objective  bodily  dimensions,  adults  should  be able to see farther than children from a visual standpoint. Yet, in reality, whether due to a lack of discipline or a lack of curiosity for knowledge, children often see a more diverse range of things. This is a visual guided by perception, where control of the body affects what is seen, and similarly, allows the external world to influence the self, leading to an understanding of perception only in consequences.

Jin Yangping cleverly showcases the meaning of "seeing" in his artworks. This process is not truly visible but tangible, which is why art historian Georges Didi-Huberman calls "seeing" "blind". So, how can this be conveyed in a more concrete way, rather than expressing it as a "face seen from behind"? We can only intuitively guess what this face might look like, but that doesn't mean we should  gaze  at  each  other.  It  means  that  what  we  observe  is  not  always  so  clear-cut,  hence precision and repeated observation become particularly important.

In the part of Kai Schiemenz, he presents the diverse objects as if in a park landscape, through which gallery-goers can stroll. He renounces elevating pedestals either completely or in favor of flat plinths, which become part of the work and complement it. There is always a relationship with the human body and its dimensions    – an eye-level on which visitor and work of art face one another.
