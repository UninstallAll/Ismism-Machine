Representative projects include predictive policing visualizations, social credit system interventions, and algorithmic decision-making exposés. These works not only make visible the hidden operations of algorithmic power but also propose alternative governance models. Works often employ tactical media strategies, creating experiences that reverse-engineer black-boxed algorithms through methods that visualize, subvert, or repurpose the computational systems that increasingly govern social life. This practice challenges the opacity of algorithmic control and pioneers new approaches to algorithmic literacy and digital sovereignty in the age of computational governance.

Posthuman Performance School: Beyond the boundaries of the human body, the Posthuman Performance School explores expanded embodiment and non-human performance. This school creates performances that transcend traditional human physicality through technological and biological extensions. The theoretical foundation merges Rosi Braidotti's posthuman theory, Donna Haraway's cyborg manifesto, and N. Katherine Hayles's posthuman body, forming a framework for posthuman performance. Artists create works that manifest expanded embodiment through human-machine performances, interspecies collaborations, and distributed agency works. Representative projects include cyborg dance, microbiome performances, and distributed consciousness installations. These works not only challenge the boundaries of the performing body but also explore new forms of agency and subjectivity. Works often reject the autonomous human subject, creating performances that distribute agency across human and non-human actors through methods that foreground the technological, biological, and ecological systems that constitute and extend the performing body. This approach challenges humanist traditions in performance and pioneers new models for embodied expression that acknowledge the posthuman condition.

Technosomatic Art Movement: At the intersection of technology and embodied cognition, the Technosomatic Art Movement explores the reciprocal relationship between technological systems and bodily experience. This movement creates works that investigate how technologies reshape somatic experience through embodied technological interfaces. The theoretical foundation merges Mark Hansen's bodies in code, Richard Shusterman's somaesthetics, and Lucy Suchman's situated action, forming a framework for technosomatic art. Artists create works that manifest the technological mediation of embodiment through haptic interfaces, proprioceptive technologies, and somatic computing systems. Representative projects include haptic communication networks, proprioceptive data visualizations, and interoceptive technology interfaces. These works not only explore the technological extension of bodily awareness but also investigate how technologies reshape our fundamental bodily experience. Works often focus on the lived experience of technology, creating interfaces that engage with the body's sensory capabilities beyond visual and auditory channels through methods that address touch, kinesthesia, proprioception, and interoception as primary sites of technological engagement. This approach challenges ocularcentric traditions in media art and pioneers new models for technological design that acknowledge the full spectrum of embodied experience.

Climate Fiction Design Movement: In response to the climate crisis, the Climate Fiction Design Movement explores possible climate futures through designed scenarios and artifacts. This movement creates speculative designs that materialize potential climate realities through narrative-driven design approaches. The theoretical foundation merges Amitav Ghosh's climate fiction theory, Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby's speculative design, and Rob Nixon's slow violence concept, forming a framework for climate fiction design. Designers create tangible manifestations of climate futures through climate scenario artifacts, adaptation technology prototypes, and climate future experience designs. Representative projects include sea level rise adaptation tools, climate refugee integration systems, and post-carbon lifestyle prototypes. These works not only make climate futures tangible but also explore alternative responses to ecological crisis. Works often employ narrative strategies, creating designed objects and experiences that function as props from possible futures through methods that translate abstract climate data and projections into emotionally resonant and tactile encounters with potential climate realities. This approach challenges the abstraction of climate discourse and pioneers new models for climate communication that engage with the lived experience of planetary change.

Decolonial Computing Movement: Against the backdrop of technological hegemony, the Decolonial Computing Movement challenges Western technological paradigms and explores alternative computing traditions. This movement creates computational systems that embody non-Western epistemologies through culturally situated computing practices. The theoretical foundation merges Arturo Escobar's designs for the pluriverse, Walter Mignolo's decolonial theory, and Linda Tuhiwai Smith's decolonizing methodologies, forming a framework for decolonial computing. Artists and technologists create works that manifest alternative technological worldviews through indigenous computing systems, non-Western algorithmic practices, and culturally situated digital tools. Representative projects include indigenous knowledge databases, non-Western mathematical computing systems, and culturally specific digital interfaces. These works not only challenge technological universalism but also explore the rich diversity of computational thinking across cultures. Works often reject the assumed neutrality of computing, creating technological systems that explicitly embed cultural values, epistemologies, and ontologies through methods that foreground the cultural situatedness of all computational practices. This approach challenges the colonial legacy in computing and pioneers new models for technological development that acknowledge the plurality of knowledge systems.
