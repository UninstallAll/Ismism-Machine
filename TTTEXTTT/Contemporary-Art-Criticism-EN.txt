Feminist Selfie-ism: In the context of the digital age, feminist selfie-ism challenges the hegemony of the male gaze in traditional art history through its unique mode of self-expression. This movement is not merely self-documentation, but redefines female subjectivity via digital media, transforming private space into a field of political statement. Drawing on Judith Butler's theory of gender performativity and Laura Mulvey's theory of visual pleasure, each frame of a selfie becomes a ritual of identity construction, challenging social norms and aesthetic standards. This practice of self-gaze, disseminated instantly through social media platforms, forms a new visual politics and reflects women's active control and representation of their own image in the digital era. Common forms include short videos, image sequences, and interactive installations, emphasizing the dialectical relationship between viewing and being viewed. Its influence has extended to the contemporary art market, gender studies, and digital anthropology, forming a unique paradigm of female digital aesthetics.
